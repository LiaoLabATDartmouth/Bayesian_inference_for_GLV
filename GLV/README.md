Our approach combines the Generalized Lotka-Volterra model (GLV) with Bayesian inference. In contrast to the canonical GLV approach, which infers model parameters using penalized Ridge regression (as described in this article: https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003388), our method leverages CMDStan (available at https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/cmdstan) to perform Bayesian regression. CMDStan provides posterior distributions for model parameters. For a demonstration of our algorithm's performance using synthetic data, please refer to the file "demonstration.ipynb."
